## ⚙️ How It Works

1. ✅ Created a simple portfolio page using `index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. ✅ Initialized a local Git repository and pushed the code to GitHub.
3. ✅ Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/root`
4. ✅ GitHub automatically deployed the site via its internal Pages workflow.
5. ✅ Customized the design with gradients, cards, fonts, and links.

## 🧪 Local Setup & Deployment

To test the site locally or make changes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anagha-07/resume-GitHubPages.git
cd resume-GitHubPages

# Make your changes to index.html or styles.css
# Then push the changes

git add .
git commit -m "update: improved design/content"

GitHub Pages will auto-deploy the latest commit from the `main` branch.
